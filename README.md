Magento 2 Opcache Control GUI using React Frontend Micro-services. 

![MAgento 2 Opcache GUI](https://github.com/nholuongut/magento-2-opcache-gui/raw/main/Magento-Opcache-Gui.jpg)

# Where to find in the Admin Menu

System -> React -> OpCache GUI

# Installation 

Copy to App code, Setup, and compile as always. 

This Extension doesn't need static content generation it uses CDN version of React JS. So, you can install with flag *--keep-generated*

or use composer: 
```
composer require genaker/module-opcache
```

# Magento 2 Opcache best settings

The biggest Magento 2 performance issue is the wrong (default) PHP OPcache settings. 

Check your PHP settings with this module:
```
opcache.enable = 1
opcache.enable_cli = 0
opcache.memory_consumption = 556
opcache.max_accelerated_files = 1000000
opcache.validate_timestamps = 0
opcache.interned_strings_buffer=64
opcache.max_wasted_percentage=5
opcache.save_comments=1
opcache.fast_shutdown=1
```
# PHP BogoMIPS performance measurement

New feature has been added. Now you will have PHP performance test on GUI open. 

Magento 2 is CPU CPU-intensive platform due to bad framework design. You should use the fastest CPU to achieve a good page rendering performance. If Magento 2 takes a 2GHz processor core 3 seconds to process a request, then the same request would be returned in around 2 seconds by a 3GHz processor core. Test your PHP performance. 

![Magento 2 PHP performance](https://github.com/nholuongut/magento-2-opcache-gui/raw/main/PHP-performance.jpg)

AWS C5.large has *0.032* PHP 7.3.23 performance score (less is better). <br/>
AWS R5.xlarge has *0.039* PHP 7.2.34 performance score (less is better). <br/>
AWS C8.xlarge has *0.029* PHP 8.1 performance score (less is better), CLI performace is: 0.066 for Cli opcache doesn't work it is well known PHP issue <br/>

Two types of BogoMIPS performance are measured from the CLI and from the web interface cached by OPcache. 

# What is BogoMIPS of the MagentoÂ Server?

MIPS stands for Millions of Instructions Per Second. It measures a Magento server code computation speed. Like most such measures, it is more often abused than used properly (it is very difficult to justly compare MIPS for different kinds of computers).
BogoMips are Linus's (Founder of Linux) own invention and Yehor Shytikov adopted this concept to the Magento servers. The linux kernel version 0.99.11 (dated 11 July 1993) needed a timing loop (the time is too short and/or needs to be too exact for a non-busy-loop method of waiting), which must be calibrated to the processor speed of the machine. Hence, the kernel measures at boot time how fast a certain kind of busy loop runs on a computer. "Bogo" comes from "bogus", i.e, something which is a fake. Hence, the BogoMips value gives some indication of the processor speed, but it is way too unscientific to be called anything but BogoMips.

It is the best way to measure Magento PHP code execution on the server and compare server performance.
